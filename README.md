# Banking_Data_Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset containing banking data of transactions with 5 features (Transaction Date, Account Number, Transaction Type, Amount, Description).

The dataset is cleaned before conducting analysis.

Anomaly detection is performed through the metric of z-score (default threshold: 2.0).

## Installation/Usage/Analysis

The code is presented as a jupyter notebook (.IPYNB) file with markdown descriptors before every code block.

Individual cell blocks need to be run (CTRL + ENTER) in succession to drive the code and analysis.

The .csv file to be analyzed must be in the same staging folder as the code file or a complete address needs to be provided in code.

Individual functions are concisely explained through parameter hints and comments.

Analysis/insights have been communicated through comments in triple quotes ("""...""").

## Libraries

The code requires the following three Python libraries to run: pandas, matplotlib, numpy
